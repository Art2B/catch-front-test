You can follow the previous steps to run the project.

## Approch
I choose to use `react` and `styled components` to stay DRY with the style of the app. 
I used `parcel` to build and run the app.
For the cards, I decided to used flexbox to make the grid easy to do.

## Problems
I got problems with the setup of the app. Installing dependencies and linking everything together take me a lot of time (around 1h) and that's what reduce the amount of front-end work I've done.

I also got problems with dynammic loads of images for the cards. I didn't manage to find a workaround in time.

I didn't had time to make the mobile version.

## What do differently
First, I would have setup the environmment before the test, to have more time on integration and development.
I should have used `react-create-app` to get started faster.

I would have write tests for the differents components
